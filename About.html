                    Groundwater plays an important role in increasing food and
                    agricultural production, providing safe drinking water and
                    facilitating industrial development in India. It
                    contributes fresh water to meet the requirement of nearly
                    65% of total irrigated area, nearly 85% of the rural
                    drinking water supply and 50% of the urban drinking water
                    needs of the country. Over the last three decades, the
                    rapid expansion in the use of groundwater, primarily for
                    irrigation, has contributed significantly to its
                    agricultural production and overall economic development.
                    This has also resulted in India becoming the largest
                    ground water extractor in the World.

                    Maharashtra is a progressive State with a positive track
                    record of development in all sectors like infrastructure,
                    irrigation, industry, agriculture, Water Supply and
                    Sanitation etc. Remote Sensing, GIS and GPS along with the
                    latest technologies of DRONES (UAV) and LiDAR are being
                    used to provide timely and accurate inputs for better

                    is being shared with many departments of Government of
                    Maharashtra for rural development. The projects like RS &

                    using High Resolution Satellite Data for Mapping and

                    <b>2. NEED FOR VILLAGE LEVEL GROUNDWATER PROSPECTS MAP</b>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ground water is the major source for all purposes of water
                    requirements in India. More than 90% of rural and nearly
                    30% of urban population depend on it for drinking water.
                    The dependency on the ground water is increasing due to
                    increase in population. In recent years, over-exploitation
                    of groundwater, particularly for irrigation, has resulted
                    in significant depletion of water tables. In the
                    over-exploited zones, the wells are getting dried up in
                    due course of time. In some of the areas, the situation is
                    so serious that there is a scarcity of water even for
                    drinking purposes. In these areas, the ground water needs
                    to be recharged artificially, as the natural recharge is
                    not sufficient, to augment the resource and maintain the
                    water table. On the other hand, the resource is not yet
                    exploited to the optimum level in many areas in the
                    country. Also, since few years various parts of the
                    country are facing severe drought, around 68% of the
                    country is prone to drought in varying degrees. Currently
                    available groundwater prospects map have their limitations
                    and scope is also limited. So, there is requirement for
                    updating 1:50,000 scale ground water prospects map to
                    1:2,000 scale to meet the present-day requirements
                    especially at village level.

                    Identification of potable ground water sources which are
                    sustainable for longer periods is a critical issue in the
                    supply of drinking water to the rural habitations in the
                    country. To address this issue, the erstwhile Department
                    of Drinking Water and Sanitation (DDWS), Ministry of Rural
                    Development (MoRD), Govt. of India which is the apex
                    organization for drinking water supply in the country has
                    requested National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), ISRO /
                    Dept. of Space, Govt. of India to prepare ground water
                    prospects maps (technically Hydro Geo Morphological-HGM
                    maps) on 1:50,000 scale using remote sensing and GIS
                    technology. The Ministry wants these maps to be used by
                    the engineers and hydro geologists of the line departments
                    in respective states for identifying ground water sources,
                    particularly for Not Covered (NC) and Partially Covered
                    (PC) habitations. NRSC has taken up the work in phased
                    manner under National Rural Drinking Water Programme
                    (NRDWP) project. The maps have already been prepared for
                    the country and handed over to the line departments in
                    respective states and hosted in Bhuvan Bhujal portal

                    (RGNDWM) on 1:50,000 scale using 23 M resolution satellite
                    data of year 2006 and groundwater quality using 2013-2018
                    pre monsoon/post monsoon water sample. This project was
                    sponsored by Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO),
                    Government of India. MRSAC and GSDA were the partner
                    institutes for preparation of groundwater prospect maps
                    and water quality maps for entire state of Maharashtra.
                    Groundwater prospect database is being shared with many
                    departments of government of Maharashtra for rural
                    development. MRSAC has started 10K Mapping for Natural
                    resources and assets under MAhaBHUMI project. Base map
                    generation is in progress for Maharashtra under MahaBHUMI
                    project wherein the mapping is being carried out on 2K and
                    publishing the topomaps on 10K. Using these 10K Basemap,
                    Geology and Geomorphology shall be interpreted.

                    NRDWP to a detailed 1:10,000 scale maps using VHR
                    satellite data. The maps can be utilized for further
